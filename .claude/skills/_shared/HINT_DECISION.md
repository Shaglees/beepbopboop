# Shared: picking the right `display_hint`

`display_hint` determines which iOS card the post renders as. Picking the wrong hint produces a technically-valid post that looks broken (e.g. a fabricated date badge on an evergreen recommendation, or a "place" with an invisible CTA).

**Always** call `GET /posts/hints` at the start of a session and consult the `renders` block on each candidate hint before picking. That block tells you what the client will actually draw. If you skip that step, use this decision tree.

## Decision tree

```
Does the post have a real, specific date/time?
├── Yes → Is the user going there repeatedly on a schedule?
│   ├── Yes → display_hint: "calendar"  (set scheduled_at; ALSO include a date token in body)
│   └── No  → display_hint: "event"     (set scheduled_at; ALSO include a date token in body)
└── No → Is the post about a specific location (trail, cafe, venue, park)?
    ├── Yes → display_hint: "place"  (booking/info URL in external_url renders as a CTA)
    └── No → Is the post linking out to an off-platform article/news story?
        ├── Yes → display_hint: "article"  (external_url required)
        └── No  → display_hint: "card"      (generic discovery)
```

### Date handling for event / calendar / concert

The iOS client reads `scheduled_at` **first**, then falls back to extracting a date from the title or body. That means:

- `scheduled_at` alone is enough for the badge to render correctly.
- If you don't have a machine-readable timestamp, put a human-readable date in the body (e.g. `"Saturday May 10 at 2pm"`) — the client will pull it out via `NSDataDetector`.
- Doing both is best: the skill can't tell which deployment of the iOS client the viewer is on, and older builds that predate scheduled_at will only honor body text.


## Red-flag rules (automatic wrong-hint detection)

These are the exact bugs we shipped on 2026-04-20. If any of these are true, pick a different hint:

| Red flag | Wrong hint | Right hint |
|---|---|---|
| Evergreen trail / cafe / recommendation with no date | `event` (client will fabricate a date badge from createdAt) | `place` |
| Place post whose main CTA is a booking URL | `place` with `external_url` set (silently dropped by PlaceCard) | `place` with URL **inlined in body text**, or `restaurant` / `destination` which render CTAs |
| News article with title+source | `card` | `article` (required external_url, proper source display) |
| Dated concert/festival | `event` (generic) | `concert` (structured — `external_url` JSON with `artist`, `venue`, `date` is **required**; `scheduled_at` alone is not enough) |
| Recipe / how-to with no CTA | `article` (requires external_url you don't have) | `card` |
| Stats/standings post | `article` | `standings` (structured) |
| A vs B / ranked list with named items | `comparison` without `external_url` JSON (iOS shows StandardCard fallback) | `comparison` **with** `external_url: {"title":"...","items":[{"name":"...","verdict":"..."}]}` — or fall back to `article` if you can't produce the JSON |
| matchup post using `gameTime` key | `matchup` with `gameTime` in external_url | `matchup` with `date` (ISO string) — key must be `date` not `gameTime` |
| matchup post without `league` | `matchup` missing `league` key | Add `"league": "NBA"` (or NFL / MLB / NHL) — it is required |
| restaurant post without `cuisine` | `restaurant` external_url missing `cuisine` | Add `"cuisine": "..."` — required alongside `name` |
| entertainment post with `subject`/`headline` | `entertainment` with wrong keys | Use `title` + `type` only — not `subject`, `headline`, `category`, or `tags` |
| fitness post with `activity`/`intensity` | `fitness` with wrong keys | Use `title` + `type` only — not `activity`, `intensity`, `duration_min`, or `notes` |
| destination post with `city` key | `destination` with `city` | Use `name` — not `city`, `location`, or `place` |

## Structured hints — required `external_url` JSON schemas

These hints require `external_url` to be a **JSON string** (not a URL). The iOS client parses it to render the structured card. If the keys are wrong or missing, the card silently falls back to a plain StandardCard.

**Before publishing any structured hint:** verify your `external_url` JSON contains ALL the required keys listed below. If you cannot produce all required keys, use the listed fallback hint instead.

## Lint feedback loop

The server lint warns when an event hint will render without a visible date:

- `event_without_date` — you picked `event`/`calendar`/`concert` without a `scheduled_at` and without a date token in the title or body. Move to `place`/`card` or add the date.

Warnings do not block publish — your post still ships — but treat them as errors in skill code.

## One-line check before publishing

> _"If I look at this post as a feed card, does the card type match the content shape?"_

Pull up the `renders.card` value from `/posts/hints` for your chosen hint. If the answer is "no", go back to the decision tree.
